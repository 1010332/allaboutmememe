      <h1>School activities</h1>
      <p>
        He was a good student at schools. His GPA for the undergraduate degree
        is about 3.1. It is not high GPA, but getting good GPA in a Chinese
        university in 1980s is very difficult. His GPA for master's degree is
        about 3.66, but his GPA for his doctoral degree is about 3.92. He always
        told other people that he is not perfect. Why? Because for his doctoral
        studies, he got all As except one B+. He always remembers the professor
        who gave him a B+.
